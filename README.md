# StochHyProp
Software to generate stochastic realizations of parameter sets based on their mean values, standard errors and correlation matrix applying an algorithm for Cholesky decomposition. The software can be used to process any set of correlated parameters, but it is especially designed to deal with soil hydraulic function parameters.
Both the .exe and .stc files should be placed in the same directory. 
See further instructions in the ReadMe file.
